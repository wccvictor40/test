I used a third party tool [1] to create an Event management App
[2] is used for adding events
[3] is used for managing events
[4] is used for viewing the registered events.

I am not sure how to build and deploy locally (no dependencies on AWS, Heroku, or other
external services), not sure how to write in Python, Ruby, or Perl but I am familiar with Java.

sorry, i am not good at making RestFul API...
